This is a simple quality of life mod that adds a command to quick stack to nearby chests or players.

Simply type `/stack` and you will automatically stack to any inventory within a 10 block radius.

Similarly, this mod also contains the ability to quick stack to nearby players. This can be helpful if you're out with another player and want to consolidate inventory space.
Simply type `/playerstack <player name>` to quick stack to any player within a 10 block radius. You can also use any of the following aliases of the command:
- `/playerstack <name>`
- `/pstack <name>`
- `/stackplayer <name>`
- `/stackp <name>`
